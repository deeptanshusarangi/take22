        <h1>Features</h1>
        <p>To achieve our mission of making education accessible in low bandwidth areas, our platform will incorporate several key features designed to facilitate effective learning using machine learning. These features include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adaptive Learning Technology:</strong> Using machine learning algorithms to adapt content based on a student's performance and learning pace.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalized Learning Pathways:</strong> ML models will analyze student data to create customized learning paths that focus on areas where students struggle.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Our platform will use predictive analytics to identify at-risk students and provide targeted interventions.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Loop Optimization:</strong> Machine learning will analyze feedback to continually improve content and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Offline Learning Modules:</strong> Students can download lessons and resources, with recommendations for offline study tailored to their needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Learning Tools:</strong> Incorporating quizzes, videos, and simulations that use ML to engage students and enhance understanding.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> Teachers can share additional resources, and ML can recommend resources based on user performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Gamification Elements:</strong> ML algorithms will personalize gamification strategies to keep students motivated and engaged.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Content Updates:</strong> Using ML to identify content gaps and ensure that learning materials are up to date.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Mechanism:</strong> A system that uses ML to analyze student feedback and continuously refine the learning experience.</li>
        </ul>
